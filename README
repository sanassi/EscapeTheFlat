Video Game Project - EPITA S2# - 2020

This is my first Unity project. It's a video game that I created during my 2nd semester @ EPITA.
I wrote most of the code, and there is a lot that I would do differently (almost 2 years later), but I will put the project here anyway. 

Project Resume:
3d iso escape the room type game, character represented by sprites
player can collect items : add time to timer, get more hp, get clues to win levels

first level/scene : TUTORIAL (explains how to play the game)

How to contribute:

clone repo and launch project in unity
